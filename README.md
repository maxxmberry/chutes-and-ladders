# Chutes and Ladders Game
In my engineering CTE class at school, I programmed a simple python version of the classic board game, Chutes and Ladders.
I started the independent project in the end of May 2021 and completed it June 16. The game consisted of material and information I have been previously taught by
my teacher. It is relatively basic since I only have around 5 months of python experience under my belt, but it is still able to run effectively.
